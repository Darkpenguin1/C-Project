# CPP_Project
This C++ project simulates streaming royalties for songs on popular music platforms. 

I used random number generators and parellel arrays that populated these generated numbers. With the code being broken down into modular functions and used decision structures. 

Artists can estimate potential earnings by inputting the type of music label (independent or major) and the number of songs to simulate. 

The program generates random stream counts for each song on platforms such as Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. 

The detailed breakdown includes total streams, earnings per platform, and average streams and earnings per platform.
